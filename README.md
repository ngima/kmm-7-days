> Getting started with Kotlin Multiplatform Mobile to build Android & iOS Apps. :smile:

This is a personal learning project where I document my daily progress on `KMM`.

* Frameworks: [KMM](https://kotlinlang.org/docs/mobile/home.html), [Ktor](https://ktor.io)

Other dependencies are maintained under `dependencies.gradle` under the `config` directory.
